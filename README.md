# **Overview**

In this project, we are performing a comparative analysis to evaluate if the most viewed tik tok videos match the songs that are charting on Spotify. Our group
pulled daily CSVs from Spotify to get the songs by artist with the most number of streams to date.

TikTok is a Chinese video-sharing platform that took over Gen Z since it's initial release in 2016. The social media platform is used for creating short-form videos from 15 seconds and up to a minute, in various genres such as; music, dance, comedy, and education. The amount of followers and likes got top users recieve in TikTok is in millions and billions. Taking into consideration that the US currently has ~328.2 Million people, having billions of followers means around the world acknowledgement. The top songs on TikTok can be represent by the number of videos that were created with them. Those numbers are in millions as well, giving artists a tremendous exposure. 

Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from creators all over the world. Spotify is available across a range of devices, including computers, phones, tablets, speakers, TVs, and cars, and you can easily transition from one to another with Spotify Connect. It is one of the world's largest music streaming service providers, with over 356 million monthly active users, including 158 million paying subscribers, as of March 2021.



# **Data Sources and Tools Used:**
Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Tableau

# **Results:**

We found that there wasn't much correlation between the two platforms.



# **Next Steps:**

Since the Spotify data only shows total number of streams to date, we could perform some analysis to understand which songs has the most streams overnight and track those songs for a certain timeframe.
