In this project, we are performing a comparative analysis to evaluate if the most viewed tik tok videos match the songs that are charting on Spotify. Our grouped
pulled daily CSVs from Spotify to get the songs by artist with the most numbe rof streams to date. In order to obtain the Tik Tok data, an API was used.


**Used:**
Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Tableau

**Results:**

We found that there wasn't much correlation between the two platforms.



**Next Steps:**

Since the Spotify data only shows total number of streams to date, we could perform some analysis to understand which songs has the most streams overnight and track those songs for a certain timeframe.
